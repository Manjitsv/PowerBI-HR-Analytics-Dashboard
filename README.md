# ðŸ“Š HR Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This HR Analytics Dashboard was built to analyze and monitor employee attrition using a single HR dataset. Out of 1,470 employees, 237 have left the organization, resulting in a 16% attrition rate â€” a level that signals serious retention challenges. The dashboard highlights attrition patterns across roles, departments, age groups, and demographics, helping HR identify areas where employee turnover is most critical.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI** â†’ Interactive dashboard and visualization design 
- **DAX** â†’ Basic measures using COUNTROWS, CALCULATE, DIVIDE, AVERAGE

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights Delivered
- ðŸ“ŒAttrition is at 16%, with the majority coming from R&D and Sales departments.
- ðŸ“Œ Lab Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists contribute ~70% of total attrition.
- ðŸ“Œ Employees aged 25â€“34 show the highest turnover, pointing to career progression and engagement issues.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- `HR Analytics Dashboard.pbix` â†’ Power BI file  
- `HR Data.xlsx` â†’ Raw dataset used

## ðŸš€ Learnings
Through this project, I learned how to:

- Build KPIs such as Attrition Rate, Total Employees, and Average Age using simple DAX functions.
- Use Power BI visuals (cards, bar, pie, donut charts) to communicate workforce trends.
- Translate raw HR data into business insights that highlight problem areas like departmental attrition and demographic risk.  

This exercise reinforced my understanding of foundational DAX and showed how even a single dataset can be converted into an actionable HR insights tool.
